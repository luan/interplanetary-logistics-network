[entity-description]
interplanetary-provider-chest=Provides items to the interplanetary logistics network. Items placed in this chest can be requested by requester chests on other planets or platforms. Requires significant power for sending items across space. Higher quality chests are more energy efficient and transfer faster.
interplanetary-requester-chest=Requests items from the interplanetary logistics network. Configure which items to request and they will be delivered from provider chests on other planets or platforms. Requires power for receiving items. Higher quality chests are more energy efficient and transfer faster.
interplanetary-provider-animation-idle=Visual effects for idle interplanetary provider chest.
interplanetary-provider-animation-active=Visual effects for active interplanetary provider chest.
interplanetary-requester-animation-idle=Visual effects for idle interplanetary requester chest.
interplanetary-requester-animation-active=Visual effects for active interplanetary requester chest.
interplanetary-roboport=Hidden logistics network for interplanetary transfers.
interplanetary-provider-power-interface=Hidden power interface for provider chest transfers.
interplanetary-requester-power-interface=Hidden power interface for requester chest transfers.

[technology-description]
interplanetary-logistics=Advanced logistics system that enables resource sharing between different planets and space platforms. Unlocks specialized chests for interplanetary item transport.
interplanetary-logistics-speed-1=Electromagnetic field manipulation from Fulgora reduces transfer time by 15%. Requires electromagnetic science.
interplanetary-logistics-speed-2=Bioengineered quantum conduits from Gleba reduce transfer time by an additional 15% (27.75% total speedup). Requires agricultural science.
interplanetary-logistics-speed-3=Cryogenic spacetime stabilization from Aquilo reduces transfer time by an additional 15% (38.6% total speedup). Requires cryogenic science.
interplanetary-logistics-speed-4=Promethium-enhanced dimensional rifts achieve ultimate transfer speeds with an additional 20% reduction (50.9% total speedup). Requires promethium science.
