interplanetary-receiving-power=Power consumption (kW) for receiving items from interplanetary transfers.
interplanetary-sending-power=Power consumption (kW) for sending items via interplanetary transfers.
interplanetary-transfer-speed=Transfer speed setting. Faster speeds require exponentially more power: Ultra-slow (50MJ), Slow (60MJ), Normal (80MJ), Fast (160MJ), Ultra-fast (400MJ) per stack. Higher quality chests provide significant efficiency (up to 70%) and speed bonuses (up to 60%).
