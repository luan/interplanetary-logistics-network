interplanetary-power-cost=Interplanetary Power Cost
interplanetary-transfer-speed=Interplanetary Transfer Speed

[mod-setting-description]
interplanetary-power-cost=Base power consumption for interplanetary transfers. Combines with transfer speed setting to determine total energy cost.
interplanetary-transfer-speed=Transfer speed setting. Faster speeds require exponentially more power: Ultra-slow (50MJ), Slow (60MJ), Normal (80MJ), Fast (160MJ), Ultra-fast (400MJ) per stack. Higher quality chests provide significant efficiency (up to 70%) and speed bonuses (up to 60%).
