## 📦 Chest Types

### 🔴 **Interplanetary Provider Chest**

- Automatically provides items to the interplanetary network
- Items can be requested by any requester chest across the galaxy
- Higher quality = more efficient and faster transfers

### 🔵 **Interplanetary Requester Chest**

- Configure specific item requests via logistic slots
- Automatically receives items from provider chests on any planet
- Smart delivery prioritizes local logistics first

## ⚡ Power & Performance

### 🔋 **Energy Costs**

Default power consumption per stack transfer:

| Speed Setting  | Energy Cost | Transfer Time |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| **Ultra-Slow** | 50 MJ       | 16 seconds    |
| **Slow**       | 60 MJ       | 8 seconds     |
| **Normal**     | 80 MJ       | 4 seconds     |
| **Fast**       | 160 MJ      | 2 seconds     |
| **Ultra-Fast** | 400 MJ      | 1 second      |

### 💎 **Quality Progression**

Quality provides **dramatic** improvements to both efficiency and speed:

| Quality       | Energy Efficiency | Speed Bonus | Example Cost\* |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| **Normal**    | 100%              | 100%        | 80 MJ / 4.0s   |
| **Uncommon**  | 85% (-15%)        | 90% (-10%)  | 68 MJ / 3.6s   |
| **Rare**      | 70% (-30%)        | 75% (-25%)  | 56 MJ / 3.0s   |
| **Epic**      | 50% (-50%)        | 60% (-40%)  | 40 MJ / 2.4s   |
| **Legendary** | 30% (-70%)        | 40% (-60%)  | 24 MJ / 1.6s   |
